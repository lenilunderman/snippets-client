## Description Snippets Application

The snippets application is the perfect application to storage snippets of code. This application allows users to create an account and create snippets of code, where they will be able to visualize, edit, and delete. Think about your next personal notebook for snippets of code. Everything in one place, on the reach of your fingertips. The application allows users to create snippets with the following attributes: type of language of that snippet, information about the snippet, and the content of the snippet itself. After the snippet is created, the user will be able to visualize all the snippets that he/she created inside the application.

## Future Updates

The user will be able to copy snippets of code and filter them by keywords. Allowing it, a better UI/UX experience. Another functionality that I would like to include in the future is a light and dark theme mode.
