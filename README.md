[Snippets Application ](https://github.com/lenilunderman/snippets-client)

**Description of the Application**

The snippets application allows the user to create an account, and storage snippets of code online. The application allows users to create snippets, edit snippets, visualize and delete snippets of code, and to change his/her password if they wish to do so.

**Future Updates**

The user will be able to copy snippets of code and filter them by keywords. Allowing it, a better UI/UX experience. Another functionality that I would like to include in the future is a light and dark theme mode.
